\begin{itemize}

\item What are the pros and cons to dimensional vs. clinical approaches to PDs? \\~\\
\item Why the reduction from 10 clinical to 6 dimensional PDs?\\~\\
\item How does the dimensional approach use as the cut-off from normal to abnormal?  Isn't that the same as the clinical approach?\end{itemize}
