Personality traits are enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the en­
vironment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts. 
Only when personality traits are inflexible and maladaptive and cause significant func­
tional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute personality disorders. The essen­
tial feature of a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior 
that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture and is manifested 
in at least two of the following areas: cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, or im­
pulse control (Criterion A). This enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad 
range of personal and social situations (Criterion B) and leads to clinically significant dis­
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Crite­
rion C). The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least 
to adolescence or early adulthood (Criterion D). The pattern is not better explained as a 
manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder (Criterion E) and is not attribut­
able to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure 
to a toxin) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma) (Criterion F). Specific diagnostic 
criteria are also provided for each of the personality disorders included in this chapter.
