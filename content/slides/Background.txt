\begin{itemize}
\item During the development process of the fifth edition of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), proposed revisions would have significantly changed the method of diagnosis for personality disorders.\\~\\
\item The propsoed revisions would have replaced the categorical approach with a trait-specific method, addressing many of the structure problems, including the overuse of PD-NOS.\\~\\
\item Clinicals would then rate these traits in terms of severity.\\~\\
\item The American Psychiatric Association (APA$_1$) Board of Trustees decided to retain the DSM-IV-TR categorical approach with the same 10 personality disorders\\~\\
\item because the trait specific method was ``too complex for clinical practice.''\\~\\
\item The proposed dimensional model was revised into a hybrid model.\\~\\
\item This alternative hybrid dimensional-categorical model was included in a supplemental chapter.
