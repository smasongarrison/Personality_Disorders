\begin{frame}[fragile]{Diagnosis}
A diagnosis of a personality disorder requires two determinations: \begin{enumerate}
\item an assessment of the level of impairment in personality functioning, which is needed for Criterion A, and 
\item an evaluation of pathological personality traits, which is required for Criterion B. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\normalsize Criterion A: Personality Functioning}
Disturbances in self and interpersonal functioning are the core of personality psychopathology \begin{itemize} \item Self functioning involves identity and self-direction; \item interpersonal functioning involves empathy and intimacy.
\item Each are evaluated with the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS); 
\item impairment ratings range from \begin{itemize} \item little or no impairment (i.e., healthy, adaptive functioning; Level 0) to \item some (Level 1), \item  moderate (Level 2), \item  severe (Level 3), and \item  extreme (Level 4) impairment.\end{itemize}\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]{\small Criterion B: Pathological Personality Traits}
\begin{itemize}\item Five broad domains: \begin{itemize} \item Negative Affectivity (vs. Emotional Stability), \item Detachment (vs. Extraversion), \item Antagonism (vs. Agreeableness), \item Disinhibition (vs. Conscientiousness), and \item Psychoticism (vs. Lucidity).\end{itemize} 
\item There are 25 facets, based on a review of existing trait models and iterative empirical research on clinical samples.\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
